1. if i were actually taking this story from someone, I'd ask for clarity on 'Can I play a different game each time?'
 - I'm going to assume this means that each game has a different outcome (ie testing for randomness) rather than that you get to
   choose whether to play player/computer or computer/computer each time

2. 'Doesn't necessarily need a flashy GUI' -> commandline (minimum viable product...)

Test steps for first acceptance criteria:
1. player can select rock, paper or scissors
2. computer randomly selects one of rock, paper or scissors
3. determine winner by applying rules
    rock > scissors
    scissors > paper
    paper > rock
4. announce winner
