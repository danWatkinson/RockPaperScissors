1. if i were actually taking this story from someone, I'd ask for clarity on 'Can I play a different game each time?'
 - I'm going to assume this means that each game has a different outcome (ie testing for randomness) rather than that you get to
   choose whether to play player/computer or computer/computer each time

2. 'Doesn't necessarily need a flashy GUI' -> commandline (minimum viable product...)
